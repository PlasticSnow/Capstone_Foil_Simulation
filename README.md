# 2025 Capstone Project 2D Airlfow Simulation

### This project is a 2D airflow simulation based on Robert Bridson's book "Fluid Simulation for Computer Graphics".

The simulation uses a **Conjugate Gradient** pressure solver with an **Incomplete Cholesky Preconditioner** and is layed out on a **Mark and Cell** grid.

For graphics and user IO, the SFML library was chosen.
